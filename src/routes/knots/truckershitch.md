## Truckers Hitch

The trucker's hitch knot was invented by truck drivers in the 1940s. The knot was designed to securely fasten loads to the back of their trucks, and was known for its ability to tighten under load. The knot quickly gained popularity among truckers and is still widely used today for securing loads on trucks, trailers and other vehicles.
