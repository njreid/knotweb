## Water Knot

The water knot was invented by a group of white water rafters in the early 20th century. The knot was specifically designed to be used in wet conditions, and is known for its ability to hold strong even when submerged in water. The knot was quickly adopted by other water sports enthusiasts, such as kayakers and canoers and is still widely used today.
