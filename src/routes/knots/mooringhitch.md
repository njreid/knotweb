## Mooring Hitch

The Mooring Hitch knot was invented by dock workers in the early 20th century. The knot was designed to secure boats to the dock and is known for its ability to withstand the constant movement of the water and wind. The knot quickly gained popularity among boaters and is still widely used today for mooring boats at docks and marinas.
