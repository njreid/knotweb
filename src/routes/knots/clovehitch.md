## Clove Hitch

The clove hitch knot has a long history, dating back to ancient times. It was used by the Egyptians for securing cargo on their ships, and was also popular among the Greeks and Romans for securing tent ropes. The knot was also used by cowboys to tie up their horses and by climbers for securing ropes.

### Instructions

1. Take the rope and make a loop, crossing the end over the standing part.
1. Make another loop in the same direction, but this time bring the end under the standing part.
1. Take the end and cross it over the first loop, then tuck it under the second loop, behind the standing part.
1. Tighten the knot by pulling on the two ends of the rope in opposite directions.

> Note: Clove Hitch is a binding knot that is commonly used to tie a rope to a post or rail. It is also used in boating, climbing and other outdoor activities, but it's not recommended to use it in critical applications, as it can slip under load.
