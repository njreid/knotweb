## Square Knot

The square knot, also known as the reef knot, has been used for centuries by sailors for tying up sails and for other purposes. The knot is believed to have originated in ancient China, and was later adopted by sailors in Europe and America. The knot is known for its simplicity and reliability, and is still widely used today in boating, fishing and other outdoor activities.
