## Bowline

The bowline knot is believed to have originated with sailors in the 16th century. It was primarily used to secure the main sail to the mast of a ship, and was known for its strength and ease of untying, even after being under tension. Sailors would often tie the knot with one hand while holding onto the sail with the other, making it a versatile and essential tool for navigating the seas.
