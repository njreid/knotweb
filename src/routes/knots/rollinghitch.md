## Rolling Hitch

The rolling hitch knot is believed to have originated with sailors in the 19th century. It was primarily used to secure rope to a spar or another rope, and was known for its ability to tighten under load. The knot was especially useful when the rope needed to be adjusted frequently, as it could be easily untied and retied.

### Instructions

1. Take the rope that you want to attach to another rope or object and make a turn around it.
1. Take the end of the rope and bring it behind the standing part of the rope.
1. Take the end of the rope and bring it over the top of the standing part of the rope.
1. Take the end of the rope and bring it under the standing part of the rope.
1. Take the end of the rope and bring it over the top of the standing part of the rope again.
1. Take the end of the rope and tuck it behind the last turn you made.
1. Pull the standing part of the rope and the end of the rope in opposite directions to tighten the hitch.

> Note: The rolling hitch is a type of binding knot used to secure a rope to a rod or pole. It is a useful knot for attaching a rope to a spar or booms, where the load is likely to be pulled along the axis of the object. It is considered a reliable and secure knot.
