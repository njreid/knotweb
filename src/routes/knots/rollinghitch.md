## Rolling Hitch

The rolling hitch knot is believed to have originated with sailors in the 19th century. It was primarily used to secure rope to a spar or another rope, and was known for its ability to tighten under load. The knot was especially useful when the rope needed to be adjusted frequently, as it could be easily untied and retied.
